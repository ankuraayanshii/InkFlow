Multi-PDF Chat Agent ü§ñ
The Multi-PDF Chat Agent is a Streamlit application that allows users to upload multiple PDF documents, extract text, and interact with the content through a conversational AI interface. The application leverages Google Generative AI for generating embeddings and FAISS for efficient similarity search.

Features
PDF Upload: Users can upload multiple PDF files.

Text Extraction: Extracts text from the uploaded PDF files.

Text Indexing: Indexes extracted text using FAISS for efficient searching.

Conversational AI: Allows users to ask questions and receive answers based on the content of the uploaded PDFs.

How It Works
PDF Loading: The app reads multiple PDF documents and extracts their text content.

Text Chunking: The extracted text is divided into smaller chunks for effective processing.

Language Model: The application generates vector representations (embeddings) of the text chunks using a language model.

Similarity Matching: When a user asks a question, the app compares it with the text chunks and identifies semantically similar ones.

Response Generation: Relevant chunks are passed to the language model, which generates a response based on the PDF content.

Key Features
Adaptive Chunking: Sliding Window Chunking dynamically adjusts window size and position for efficient data access.

Multi-Document Conversational QA: Supports queries across multiple documents, breaking the single-document limitation.

File Compatibility: Handles both PDF and TXT file formats.

LLM Model Compatibility: Works with various language models, including Google Gemini Pro, OpenAI GPT-3, Anthropic Claude, and Llama2.
